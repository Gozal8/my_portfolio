          About Me
          I am Jo'raboyeva Go'zal Davlatovna, currently studying as a Full Stack Developer. 
          I have been gaining knowledge and experience in the field of programming for 1.5 years. 
          I am equally interested in both frontend and backend development, which is why I strive to grow in both areas as a full-stack developer.
          My main goal is to explore the world through the eyes of a developer, work on innovative ideas that bring convenience to people, 
          and continuously stay updated with new technologies.

            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>
              On September 1, 2012, I took my first step into school. In 2016, I changed my school and studied there until I graduated from high school.
               I enjoyed subjects like Computer Science, Mathematics, and English. Besides that, I actively participated in various events as a host.
               As they say, "a little from every field"—I was a talented and versatile student.

            <h3>Najot Ta'lim</h3>
            <p>
              During my final years of school, I started thinking about my future career. I realized that I wanted a profession that was both modern and exciting—one that required continuous 
              self-improvement and lifelong learning. That’s when I discovered programming. At that time, I had almost no knowledge of programming. So, I chose Najot Ta'lim, 
              a place that helps you grow from zero to the level you aspire to. In late September to early October of 2023, I enrolled at Najot Ta'lim to pursue my journey in programming.

            <h3>Foundation</h3>
            <p>
              Since I had little understanding of programming, I studied for 5 months in the Foundation course. With each lesson, I gained new experiences and knowledge.
              This journey made me realize my passion for diving deeper into the field of programming and continuously acquiring new skills.

            <h3>Full Stack</h3>
            <p>
              In 2024, I started studying Full Stack Development because I wanted to learn both backend and frontend. Through this journey, I realized that this field was the perfect fit for me.
              I began acquiring new skills, and my instructors, who were highly knowledgeable, always emphasized the importance of becoming true professionals in our field.
